	<h1> About the Site </h1>
	<p>I created this site primarily as a tool to help see what is trending at any particular moment by looking at social media.
	The tools on this site can be useful to businesses looking for information about consumer markets or their own standing within
	the population as shown by social media. Or if you are am individual who is curious about how your social network profiles may 
	reflect on you this site has tools to display information such as your lexical diversity, if I am creative I may even attempt to
	provide humorous feedback.</p>
	
	<p>Right now this site is in its early alpha stages and I plan on adding many features over the coming weeks including more social 
	media platforms, analyzing tools, and perhaps games (Gaming is a big hobby of mine!).</p>
