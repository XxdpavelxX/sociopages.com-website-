   <p> * Note: If the following table "Fund Name, Amount of Holdings" is empty it means that there are no H1-FR files for 
	the mutual fund associated with the specified cik number, or the cik number does not exist.  Make sure the cik number 
	is typed correctly and that the mutual fund has an H1-FR file on the EDGAR database. Feel free to contact me
