	<ul
	<li> <span style="font-family:impact" >Words</span>: This value represents the lexical diversity of the words in the text of the tweets. For example if it 
	is 0.67 that means that about two out of every three words is unique, or you could say that each status 
	update carries around 67% unique words. Since the average number of words in a sing;e tweet is approximately 6, that 
	translates to 4 unique words for each tweet. When processing this data it is important to also take into account the nature of the 
	tweets and the purpose of the account. For example you can usually expect an account advertising a product to frequently use the
	product's name and thus have a lower lexical diversity.</li>
	
	<li> <span style= "font-family:impact">Screen Names</span>: The lexical diversity of the screen names mentioned following the specified hashtag.
	For example a value of 0.95, means that about 19 out of 20 screen names mentioned are unique. </li>
	<li> <span style="font-family:impact" >Hashtags</span>: The lexical diversity of the hashtags mentioned besides the specified hashtag in the search.</li>
	<li> <span style="font-family:impact">Avg Length of Tweets</span>: The average length of tweets in words that include the specified hashtag. </li>
	</ul>
